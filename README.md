# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applying correctly to an HTML element. The background color changes on hover, but other styles, such as text color, font weight, and padding, remain unaffected.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file contains the HTML code with the problematic Tailwind CSS classes.  The expected behavior is for all classes to be applied, resulting in red background text with padding, which changes to a darker red on hover. However, only the hover background color change works.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version of the code where the missing styles are correctly applied. This solution addresses the underlying cause, resolving the issue.
