The issue was likely caused by a missing or incorrectly configured Tailwind CSS configuration file or build process.  Ensuring that your Tailwind CSS setup is correct, including proper configuration and build steps, is crucial. Here's the corrected code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind CSS Bug</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover me
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

This solution uses a CDN link to Tailwind CSS for simplicity.  For more complex projects, make sure to follow Tailwind's official documentation for proper installation and setup in your preferred environment.
